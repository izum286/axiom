## When to Use This Reference

Use this reference when you need:
- Specific metadata field requirements or character limits

- Privacy manifest schema fields or Required Reason API categories
- Age rating tiers and capability declarations
- EU DSA trader status requirements
- IAP submission pipeline and review flow
- Build upload SDK requirements and processing details
- WWDC25 submission changes (draft submissions, accessibility labels, tags)

**For pre-submission workflow:** See [App Store Submission](/skills/shipping/app-store-submission) for the pre-flight checklist and pressure scenarios.

**For rejection troubleshooting:** See [App Store Diagnostics](/diagnostic/app-store-diag) for diagnosis from rejection message to fix.
