# App Store Submission

Systematic pre-flight checklist that catches 90% of App Store rejection causes before submission. A 30-minute pre-flight saves 3-7 days of rejection-fix-resubmit cycles.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you're:
- Preparing to submit an app or update to the App Store
- Submitting your first app as a new developer
- Responding to an App Review rejection
- Running a pre-submission audit before TestFlight or production
- Updating an existing app after a long gap (new requirements may apply)
- Wondering "is my app ready to submit?"

**Core principle:** Ship once, ship right. Over 40% of rejections cite Guideline 2.1 (App Completeness), and another 30% are metadata and privacy issues. These are preventable.

## Example Prompts

Questions you can ask Claude that will draw from this skill:

- "Is my app ready to submit to the App Store?"
- "What do I need before submitting my first iOS app?"
- "I keep getting rejected, what am I missing?"
- "What's the pre-submission checklist for App Store?"
- "Do I need a privacy manifest?"
- "My app update was rejected for metadata issues"

## What This Skill Provides

### Pre-Flight Checklist (8 Categories)
Complete mandatory checklist covering build configuration, privacy requirements, metadata fields, account/authentication, App Review info, content completeness, regional compliance, and new 2025-2026 requirements.

### Anti-Patterns with Time Costs
8 common submission mistakes — submitting without device testing, missing privacy policy, placeholder content, ignoring privacy manifest, missing Sign in with Apple, no account deletion, wrong age rating, missing demo credentials — each with the days lost and prevention steps.

### IAP Submission Checklist
- Review screenshot required for each IAP product
- IAP products must be attached to the version (checkbox in ASC, first submission only)
- Terms of Use and Privacy Policy links on paywall (`SubscriptionStoreView` handles automatically; custom UI must add manually)
- Subscription terms visible before purchase (price, period, auto-renewal)

### Decision Tree
Step-by-step "Is my app ready?" walkthrough covering crashes, privacy manifest, privacy policy, screenshots, account deletion, SIWA, IAP, encryption, EU compliance, demo credentials, age rating, and placeholder content.

### Pressure Scenarios
Three scenarios that prevent rationalization under deadline pressure, repeated rejections, and false confidence from prior approval.

### Handling Rejections
Reading rejection messages, response strategy, when to appeal, expedited review eligibility (critical bug fix, event-related), "Meet with App Review" scheduling, bug fix leniency, and metadata vs binary rejection differences.

## Key Pattern

### The 30-Minute Pre-Flight

```
Before EVERY submission, run the complete checklist:

1. Build Configuration  — Physical device, latest SDK, IPv6, release config
2. Privacy              — Manifest, policy (ASC + in-app), purpose strings, ATT
3. Metadata             — Name, screenshots, keywords, "What's New"
4. Account              — Deletion flow, SIWA, Restore Purchases
5. App Review Info      — Contact info, demo credentials, notes
6. Content              — No placeholders, all links work, production assets
7. Regional             — EU DSA trader status, age rating, export compliance
8. New Requirements     — Updated age rating, accessibility labels, SDK minimum
```

**Before**: 11 days lost to three preventable rejections.
**After**: 30-minute pre-flight catches all issues, approved on first submission.
